# nsw-topo-split

`nsw-topo-split` is a simple Python package that provides a command-line
interface for downloading and evenly splitting NSW Spatial Services topographic
maps into A3 pages with 20mm overlaps. This is useful if you can't get an
official hard copy (e.g., for a new edition), or if you don't have access to a
large-format printer to print the GeoPDFs provided on the [NSW Spatial
Collaboration
Portal](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=06e3c2e0de1e4efda863854048c613c6).

## Quick example
```
python -m nsw_topo_split katoomba 2022
```

  year           Year of publication

For example, `python -m nsw_topo_split katoomba 2022` will produce three PDFs in
the current working directory:
- `8930-1S+KATOOMBA.pdf`: The original map downloaded from Spatial Services
- `8930-1S+KATOOMBA_cover.pdf`: A portrait A3 page with the map cover page
    and legend side-by-side
- `8930-1S+KATOOMBA_split.pdf`: The map, split across six landscape A3 pages
  with 20mm overlaps.

When printing double-sided, make sure to choose "flip on long edge".
